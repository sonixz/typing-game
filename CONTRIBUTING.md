## 💻 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Keep it simple**: Pure vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks
- **Maintain the aesthetic**: Cyberpunk neon theme (cyan #00ffff, pink #ff0080, purple #8a2be2)
- **Single file architecture**: Keep the game in `index.html` when possible
- **Comment when necessary**: Code should be self-explanatory, but complex logic needs comments
- **Test in multiple browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### Commit Messages
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb: "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Refactor"
- Example: `Add particle explosion effects for enemy deaths`

### Testing
- Test locally before submitting PR
- Make sure the game still works after your changes
- Test different difficulty levels and scenarios
- Check browser console for errors

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**100% Vibe Coding** - We prioritize:
1. **Feel**: Does it feel good to play?
2. **Look**: Does it look awesome?
3. **Fun**: Is it fun to code and play?

Performance and optimization come second to these principles.

- **Mockups**: Visual ideas are welcome!

## 📝 Pull Request Process

4. Test thoroughly
5. Write a clear PR description explaining your changes

## 🎮 Word Pool Contributions

Adding new words? Make sure they:
- Fit the difficulty tier (easy/medium/hard/boss)
- Are appropriate for all audiences
- Are common English words or tech terms
- Don't duplicate existing words

## 🌍 Internationalization

Want to add word pools for other languages? We'd love that! Just:
- Create a new JSON file: `words-{language}.json`
- Follow the same structure as `words.json`
- Update the game logic to support language selection
